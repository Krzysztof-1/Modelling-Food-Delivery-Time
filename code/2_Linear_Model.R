***NINA: WEsHALB unterschiedliche skalen auf x und y achsen von qq plot***
*** NINA: WERTE PRÃœFEN ***
Interpretation of summary of linear model <lm.delivery1>

General remarks

1) Intercept:
The intercept on the log transformed target variable is at 2.512.
exP(2.5283589) = 12.5329214
Interpretation: the intercept is the delivery_time we expect if all other variables = 0 and
the categorial variables are at reference level.
The time of 12.53 minutes is of no practical relevance here.


2) <distance_km>: 

There is strong evidence that the slope for disctance_km is not flat.

For each increase of 1 unit in distance_km (km) the log transformed response variable will
increase by 0.0133558. The exponentiated delivery_time_min will increase by 1.0134453 which corresponds to 1.34%.


3) <courier_rating_1_to_5

There is no evidence that courier_rating_1_to_5 has a significant effect on the response variable.
This can be seen by looking at the p-value [0.242] which is much higher than 0.05. 
Also it can be seen by the confidence intervals of this coefficient: [-0.01506945  0.003810957] which contains 0.

(in a next step this coefficient will be dropped)


4) <traffic_level_factor>

Before fitting the model we've set the traffic_level_factor> [very low] as reference category.
This means that all the other factors from low - very high show the difference to this reference level.

I.e. with increasing traffic the delivery time increases (strongly).

All factors show very strong evidence against the null hypothesis that there is no effect.
This can be seen by looking at the p-values which are very small.

Example for interpretation: the coefficient for traffic_level_factor [very high] is 1.2187542 (on the log transformed target variable).
To interpret this on the original scale we need to exponentiate:

exp(1.2187542) = 3.3829707 

******************************* NINA KORREKTUR ***************************************
--> this means that (if all other variables are held constant) deliveries under <very high> traffic conditions
take on average 3.38 times as long as under <very low> traffic conditions.
******************************* NINA KORREKTUR ***************************************

5) <order type factor>

For the order_type_factor the reference category is <Buffet>. 
All factors show very strong evidence against the null hypothesis that there is no effect.

Compared to traffic_level_factor the different factors show a much smaller impact.
<Drinks> takes longer than the other categories and <Meal> is delivered faster. 

Exmplae for drinks:
coefficient (for log transformed target variable) is 0.2140612.
exp(0.2140612) ~ 1.2386985 --> which leads to a 23.8% longer delivery time.

One approach to explain this could be that the handling of drinks is a bit more delicate. 
But this is just speculation.

Overall model performance: 

1)R-squared: 0.9202

This value indicates that 92.02% of the total variance in the log transformed target variable is explained.

2) Adjusted R-squared: 0.9201

Adjusted R-squared corrects the normal R-squared for the number of predictors used (i.e. it penalized complexer models).
Here the adjusted R-squared is almost identical to R-squared. This indicates that all predictors contribute to the model.

3) Residual standard error: 0.1332

The residual standard error estimates the standard deviation of the residuals (i.e. difference between observed
and fitted values).

**************************[KORREKTUR NINA]**************************************************
The number from summary() --> 0.1332 is the deviation on the log-scale. To interpret this we need to exponentiate it.
exp(0.1332) ~ 1.142.

Interpretation: the fitted delivery times are on average around 14.2 % above or below the observed delivery times.
**************************[KORREKTUR NINA]**************************************************

Diagnostic plots

We furthermore performed two diagnostic plots on the lm.delivery1

a) Plotting residuals vs fitted values.

We can observe that our data points are more or less centered around 0. 
Also we can see that most of the residuals lie within -0.4 and +0.4.

What we can see however is certain vertical stripes - these jumps are likely to be caused
by the categorical variables we used. 

Also we can see a small effect of heteroscedasticity towards the right side (larger values).
This is a hint that the variance is not completely constant which would be in violation of a basic assumption for linear
modelling: Homoscedasticity.

For now we will not implement further measures and tolerate what we have seen.
We did not see an indication of a serious violation of model assumptions.


In a next step we will use drop1() to investigate the effect of removing a certain variable
from our model. I.e. <what happens if we remove one variable and the rest remains the same>.

"""

# using drop1() on first linear model
drop1(lm.delivery1, test = "F")

"""
From looking at the output (as also visible in summary() above) we can see that
<courier_rating_1_to_5> has a high p-value. Therefore we can not reject the null hypothesis that slope of this
variable is flat. 

Furthermore when looking at RSS and AIC we can see that if we remove this variable the RSS increases only very little
i.e. from 128.16 to 128.19 and that the AIC remains the same.

That means that removing this variable does not worsen the model.

All other variables explain the variance and have very low p-values. Meaning that we should not remove them.

"""
In a next step we will also check for interaction between traffic_level_factor and distance_km.
Reason: the effect of distance on time could be bigger if on a long distance there is a lot of traffic.

By including interaction between distance_km and traffic_level_factor we allow
the effect of distance_km to differ depening on the traffic_level_factor.

The model contains all main effects as well as all interaction terms between distance and traffic level.

By looking at summary() we can directly see that:

- Residual Standard error is smaller as for lm.delivery2 (i.e.: better model!)
- Multiple R-squared and adjusted R-squared are also a littler higher

***NINA: Was soll gesagt werden mit F-Statistik?***
- F-statistic: tests null hypothesis that all regression coefficients (apart from intercept = 0). There is strong evidence against that
- The number in F-statistic is higher for lm.delivery2 --> this is most likely due to more predictors (12)

--> F statistic from summary only compares against zero model (see above)

In order to compare lm.interaction and lm.delivery2 we will use anova and AIC.
"""

# AIC to compare models
AIC(lm.delivery2)
AIC(lm.interaction)

# anova to compare models
anova(lm.delivery2, lm.interaction)

"""
Both Akaike Information Criterion and ANOVA are in favour of the model with interation lm.interaction.

AIC:    the AIC is lower for the interaction model 385 points
ANOVA:  residual sum of squares is lower by 6.79 with an F value of 100.79 and a very low p-value.

By comparing the two models we choose to go on with the model that includes an interaction term.
lm.interaction explains more variance.

Meaning that the effect ot the distance is dependend on the traffic level.

Conclusion: we decide to use lm.interaction as our preferred model.

To investigate the prediction on the test data, we plot the actual delivery time vs. predicted delivery time.
Furthermore we included error bars (vertical line between actual and predicted values).

- We can see on this plot that for predictions < 40 min the distance between points and the red line is small. I.e. our model works very good for this range.
- With increasing delivery time, the scattering gets much bigger, > 50 minute.
- For very large delivery times there are a few extreme outliers.
- The general structure is linear - all in all this model is stable.

We furthermore calcualted the root mean squared error and r_squared for the testdata.

- RMSE:       5.59 minutes (meaning that the average prediction error is around 5.6 minutes)
